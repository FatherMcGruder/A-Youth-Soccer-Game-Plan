This project is just an Excel spreadsheet sheet to plan substitutions an make sure players get equal enough time on the field and in different positions.

Currently, it's set up for 9v9 games with a 3-3-2 formation. Use find-replace to change 'Player #' to your actual players' names. Look at the bottom and right tables for help finding mistakes and imbalances in play time.
